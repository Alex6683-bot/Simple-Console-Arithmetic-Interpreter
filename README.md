->This is my second attempt to making an interpreter that can handle basic arithmetic expressions.

->The program can handle expressions including basic operators such as ADD, SUB, MUL and DIV. 

->It also supports parenthesis. NOTE: I have been working on adding basic mathematical functions such as sin, cos, tan, round etc but the required code has been commented out due to some issues, which is expected to be fixed in a later version..

->The program could still come across problems and bugs and I would appreciate if you report it. 

->Some of the implementations has been written way long ago and may be prone to many issues. Another issue is that the program only supports numbers upto 4 bytes (float).

->I will port the data types to a larger size in later versions.
